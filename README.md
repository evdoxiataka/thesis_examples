# Drivers' Reaction Time Problem
## Examples used in my PhD Thesis

### Data
The drivers' reaction time dataset used in these examples (*evaluation_sleepstudy.csv*) is from Belenky et al. (2003). 

It can be retrieved from: https://benlambertdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/all_data.zip. 

### Models
The PyMC3 code for the probabilistic homogenous, heterogenous, and hierarchical models mentioned in Chapters 1, 2, and 3 can be found in the *driver_reaction_time.ipynb*.
